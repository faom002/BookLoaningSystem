# Book Loaning System
BookLoaningSystemExam is a project aimed at facilitating the borrowing and returning of books from a database. The system utilizes MySQL and Java for managing book records and transactions.

Installation
To set up and run the Book Loaning System, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/faom002/BookLoaningSystem.git

Install MySQL, a powerful tool for managing databases. You can download and install MySQL from the official website.

Open the project in your preferred IDE. We recommend using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, but the Community edition will also suffice.

Install the database scripts provided in the project. These scripts will create the necessary tables and populate them with sample data.

Configure the JDBC connection URL to match your own database setup. Update the database connection details in the project configuration files to establish a connection to your MySQL database.

Usage
The Book Loaning System allows users to perform the following actions:

Borrow books: Users can search for available books in the database and borrow them. The system tracks the borrowing history and updates the book's status accordingly.

Return books: Users can return borrowed books to the database. The system updates the book's availability status and marks the transaction as complete.

The source code is well-documented, making it easy to understand and modify according to your requirements. Feel free to explore and enhance the functionality of the system as needed.
